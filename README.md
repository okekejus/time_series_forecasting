# Condo Unit Forecasting
Work related project involving the forecasting of monthly "units" created. 

## Business Need 
- The ability to predict the total number of units created every month, to a certain degree of accuracy.

## Data Collection 
All the data used for this project exists within the Condominium Authority of Ontario's databases, as a result, they cannot be shared publicly. I used an SQL query to fetch the following for each corporate entry in our : 
- Account Name
- Registration Date
- Total Units

## Pre-Processing 
This specific dataset is already quite clean within our database, as a result, not much of that was required.
